<mark style="background-color:purple;">NO TEAM TOKENS</mark> **-** The Dexminer Team will **NOT** hold any tokens. The only tokens owned by the Dexminer Treasury will be collected via accumulating trading fees. We are committed to the longevity of the project and thus the $DXM team cannot dump on you.

<mark style="background-color:purple;">NO EXTRA MINT OR HIDDEN TOKENS</mark> **-** The $DXM smart contract has **NO** ability to mint extra tokens nor can the supply be manually increased or used in an artificial way to change the initial supply by awarding ourselves free tokens.&#x20;
